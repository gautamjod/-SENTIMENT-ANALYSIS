 Project Summary: Sentiment Analysis Using NLP
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of performing sentiment analysis on textual data (e.g., movie reviews, tweets) to classify them into positive or negative sentiments. We will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for data preprocessing and Logistic Regression for classification.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview
Dataset Used: IMDb movie reviews (available via sklearn.datasets.load_files) or any other text data like tweets or product reviews (CSV files can be used).

Number of Samples: 2,000 reviews (1,000 positive, 1,000 negative).

Features: Text data (reviews in string format).

Target Variable:

0 â†’ Negative Sentiment

1 â†’ Positive Sentiment

ðŸ”§ Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning:

Converted text to lowercase.

Removed punctuation, special characters, and HTML tags.

Tokenization:

Split the text into individual words.

Stopword Removal:

Removed common stopwords like "and," "the," "is," which do not carry significant meaning in sentiment analysis.

Stemming:

Used the Porter Stemmer to reduce words to their root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").

2. Text Vectorization
Used TF-IDF Vectorizer (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical format. This representation highlights important words based on their frequency across documents while reducing the influence of common words.

3. Model Selection and Training
Logistic Regression was chosen for classification. It is a simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification tasks and works well with high-dimensional data like text.

4. Model Evaluation
The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted sentiment labels.

Confusion Matrix: To visualize the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Classification Report: Detailed metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score for both classes (positive and negative).

5. Visualization
The results were visualized using a Confusion Matrix, which was plotted using Seaborn to gain insights into how well the model distinguishes between positive and negative sentiments.

âœ… Results
Accuracy Achieved: ~85-90% (depending on the dataset)

Confusion Matrix: The model performed well in classifying both positive and negative reviews, with relatively low false positives and false negatives.

Performance Metrics:

High Precision and Recall for both classes.

Balanced performance between Positive and Negative sentiment classification.

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables

Data loading and cleaning

NLP preprocessing (text cleaning, stopword removal, stemming)

Vectorization using TF-IDF

Logistic Regression model training and evaluation

Performance insights through metrics and confusion matrix visualization

Project Documentation: A detailed breakdown of the steps and methodology involved in the project.

ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using techniques like GridSearchCV to fine-tune the Logistic Regression model.

Model Comparison: Comparing the performance of different models, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks (LSTMs for sequence data).

Deep Learning Models: Implementing LSTM or BERT for better sentiment prediction.

Improved Text Cleaning: Incorporating techniques like lemmatization or using spaCy for advanced NLP tasks.

This project can be extended to include more complex datasets such as tweets or product reviews. It can also be deployed as a web-based sentiment analysis tool using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit.
